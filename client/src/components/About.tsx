                What began as a senior capstone project became a mission for a group of classmates: 
                to solve a common yet persistent challengeâ€”helping friends find the perfect midpoint 
                to meet and spend time together. With the application in its early stages, the team 
                focused on building a tool that simplifies the planning process, suggesting convenient 
                locations that suit everyone. Our goal is to make meeting up easy and accessible, 
                giving friends more time together to create quality memories.
